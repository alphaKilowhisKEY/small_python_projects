"""
Monday Motivation Email Sender

This Python script sends a Monday motivation email containing a random quote from a file named "quotes.txt". The email is sent only if the current day is Monday.

Libraries Used:
- smtplib: for sending emails via SMTP
- datetime: for working with dates and times
- random: for generating random numbers

Process:
- Check if the current day is Monday (weekday == 0).
- If it's Monday, open the "quotes.txt" file and read all quotes into a string.
- Select a random quote from the list of quotes.
- Establish an SMTP connection with the Gmail SMTP server.
- Start TLS encryption for a secure connection.
- Log in to the sender's Gmail account.
- Send an email with the selected quote as the message body and "Monday Motivation" as the subject.

Usage:
- Replace "user_name@gmail.com" and "*********" with the sender's Gmail email address and password, respectively.
- Make sure the "quotes.txt" file contains quotes separated by newlines.
- Run the script on Mondays to send Monday motivation emails automatically: $python3 main.py
